{{< text_snippet >}}

In the Alpha documentation, I aim to explain Alpha, from installation to everyday use, in the most concise and straightforward way possible.
My goal is to make it approachable for newcomers to Hugo, while still keeping it efficient for more experienced users.

Although Alpha is a solo project, every helping hand is welcome.
From *translations* and *bug reports* to *feedback* or *sponsorship*, it all helps.
