{{< status_card TITLE="Note" TYPE="warning" >}}

This shortcode is part of **Alphaâ€™s LiVa system** and will not work unless **LiVa is enabled**. Its goal is to improve the writing workflow, **not** for end-user display.

{{< /status_card >}}

## Code
```go-html-template
{{</* help TYPE="markdown" */>}}
```
### Overview
The **help** shortcode displays a quick-reference cheatsheet directly inside the page using the LiVa UI.
It is meant as an authoring-time helper, it renders only during local development and **does not appear** in production builds.

Use it as an in-browser guide to check available shortcode syntax or Markdown formatting rules without leaving your project.

To function, LiVa must be active:
- `liva_enabled = true` in `config/_default/params.toml`
- Site running in development mode (`hugo server`)

### Usage
- Place the shortcode anywhere in your content where you want help displayed.
- Preview the page in your browser to see the cheatsheet appear.

: `TYPE="markdown"` --- (**string**, optional)
