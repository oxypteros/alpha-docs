### Overview
Displays a featured post with a title, summary, and **Read Now** link.

### Usage
- Set `featured = true` in the frontmatter of the content page you want to feature and restart the `hugo server` to preview.
- Use this shortcode on the homepage and section pages (i.e. `_index.md`).
- The shortcode displays the page summary based on Hugoâ€™s priority:
    1. A `<!--more-->` marker in the Markdown content.
    2. A manually defined `summary` in the front matter.
    3. An automatically generated excerpt (first `~70` words).

Alpha **recommends** using a **manually defined** frontmatter summary (`summary = ""`) for better readability, visual consistency, and SEO.

**Tip:** Only one featured post is shown at a time. If multiple posts are marked, the most recent one (*by date*) is selected.
### Parameters Reference
TYPE
: `TYPE="plain"` ---  (**string**, optional) 
: Controls the visual style of the featured section.
: TYPE values:`banner`, `simple`, `plain`(default)
